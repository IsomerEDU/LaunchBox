                <p>So you've discovered the perfect worker or product, or have you?  Unless you have a money tree, make sure you're buying something of value.  We all regret purchasing a lackluster product or hiring the wrong worker, right?</p>
                <p>Make smart decisions and hire the perfect worker with the tips below.</p>
                <p><strong>Does the worker provide a robust description of the service or product provided?</strong>  Steller sellers put time and thought into marketing their microbusiness.  Does the job description list key skills or experience and is the text error-free?  Can you tell why the service or product will solve a problem or improve your life?</p>

                <p><strong>Hire sellers with high star-ratings and excellent reviews.</strong>  Top sellers might cost more, but you don't want to waste your money on an inferior experience.</p>

                <p><strong>Or hire new sellers ... but buyer beware.</strong>  Newbies often provide affordable products or services.  They offer an attractive price in hopes of making their first sale and growing their reputation.  Never hire a new seller without viewing work samples. Also, ask for references and check them.</p>

                <p><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Contact the seller to clarify any questions you have prior to buying a service.   Hire sellers that quickly respond to questions and provide informative answers.</p>
